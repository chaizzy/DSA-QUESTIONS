    "Word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing by representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space, where similar words are represented by vectors that are closer together. This is achieved by training models on large amounts of text data using techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe. These models learn to encode semantic relationships between words based on their co-occurrence patterns in the training data. As a result, words with similar meanings or contexts end up with similar vector representations. This allows algorithms to capture the meaning of words and understand their relationships, enabling tasks such as word similarity, document classification, and sentiment analysis."
